    "The [2023.4 release](https://sire.openbiosim.org) introduces support for [GPU-accelerated molecular dynamics alchemical free energy simulations](https://sire.openbiosim.org/tutorial/index_part06.html). This builds on the [integration with OpenMM]() introduced in the 2023.2 release, and the support for [trajectories](https://sire.openbiosim.org/versions/devel/cheatsheet/trajectory.html) and [units](https://sire.openbiosim.org/versions/devel/cheatsheet/units.html) introduced in 2023.3.\n",

    "The concept of a [merged molecule](https://sire.openbiosim.org/tutorial/part06/01_merge.html) is central to the way that free energy calculations are implemented in sire. A merged molecule is one that represents both a “reference” state and a “perturbed” state. These are the two states that the free energy simulation will morph between, and for which the free energy difference will be calculated.\n",

    "Not bad - both methods agree that the free energy calculated from these simulations is 3.0 kcal mol-1. This is only a rough estimate of the relative free energy, as we only used three λ-windows, and only ran very short (10 ps) dynamics simulations. A better estimate could be made by running more λ-windows and running longer dynamics simulations at each window.\n",
    "\n",
    "[This script](https://sire.openbiosim.org/tutorial/part06/06_faster_fep.html#complete-example-script) let's you run longer simulations across more λ-windows, running the perturbation both for ethane to methanol in the gas phase and also in a box of water. Running 250 ps of dynamics across 21 evenly-spaced λ-windows gives a gas-phase relative free energy of 2.98 +/- 0.01 kcal mol-1. Our value calculated above using only three λ-windows and short simulations is remarkably close!\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining this with the water-phase relative free energy of -3.30 +/- 0.02 kcal mol-1 gives a predicted relative hydration free energy of ethane and methanol of -6.28 +/- 0.02 kcal mol-1. This is in excellent agreement with [values computed with other codes](https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/75900057/20181010_Michel_reprod.pdf).\n",

    "Now that we know that the free energy code works, our focus now is checking accuracy and performance for protein-ligand relative and absolute binding free energy simulations. To do this, we've implemented support for [restraints](https://sire.openbiosim.org/tutorial/part06/03_restraints.html). These restraints can be [morphed using λ](https://sire.openbiosim.org/tutorial/part06/04_alchemical_restraints.html), via our new [LambdaSchedule objects](https://sire.openbiosim.org/tutorial/part06/02_alchemical_dynamics.html#controlling-perturbations-with-a-schedule). This schedule gives you control over how forcefield parameters and restraints are changed as a function of λ. For example, [here we show](https://sire.openbiosim.org/tutorial/part06/04_alchemical_restraints.html#alchemical-restraints) how you can set up a schedule that slowly turns on some restraints before morphing from the reference molecule to the perturbed molecule. Then, after the morph, these restraints are slowly turned off.\n",

    "We think that this framework, and the concepts of merged molecules and λ-schedules gives a lot of power to users and developers of free energy simulations. We're looking forward to exploring this new functionality ourselves, and also seeing what everyone else in the community creates.\n",
